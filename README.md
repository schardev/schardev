### Hey, I'm Saurabh.

I'm a self-taught front-end web developer based in Maharashtra, India, with a passion for building clean and high performing web apps. Learning about how stuff works behind the scenes, and geeking out on web performance and security always get me excited.

When I'm not busy churning out code, you can probably find me watching anime or tinkering around with my Linux setup.
